Introduction
========================================================
The data we are using comes from the UCI Automobile Data Set that can be found in this link http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile.

Using this dataset we build a linear regrssion model over several variables and then predict the price of a car given these same variables. In order to achieve the outcome there were several steps:

- Explatory Data Analysis
- Clean the Data
- Build the model
- Run a prediction on the model 

We used the following variables from the automobile dataset to create the prediction: Make, Body Style, Engine Size, Horsepower, and Highway MPG. this is demonstrated through the following shiny app: https://chrisbens.shinyapps.io/CarPricePrediction

A Bit of Exploratory Data Analysis
========================================================
```{r, fig.width = 20, fig.height = 12, echo=FALSE}
par(mar=c(7.1,4.1,4.1,2.1))
make = dfCars$make
price = dfCars$price
plot(make, price, ylab="Price ($)", las=2, main="Make vs Price")
```

A Model for Prediction
=======================================================
class: small-code
<small>Below we show model and the variables used to predict price</small>
```{r, echo=FALSE, width=20, size="small"}
mod <- lm(price ~ make + body_style + engine_size + horsepower + highway_mpg, data=dfCars)
summary(mod) # show results
```
<small>From these results and the results on the next slide, this model has a pretty good fit over the data. A Residual standad error of `r round(summary(mod)$sigma)` and an Adjusted R^2 value is `r round(summary(mod)$adj.r.squared, 2)` provides for a good model.</small> 


Summary
=======================================================
class: small-code
If we run a predict command over the model using some new data, we get the following prediction
```{r, echo=TRUE}
make = "nissan"
body_style = "sedan"
engine_size = 140
horsepower = 100
highway_mpg = 25

newCar <- data.frame(make, body_style, engine_size, horsepower, highway_mpg) 
pred <- predict(mod, newCar, interval = "prediction")
pred
```
The 95% prediction interval for the above variables puts the price of a `r paste(make, ' ', body_style, ' with an engine size of ', engine_size, ', horsepower of ', horsepower, ' and an average Highway MPG of ', highway_mpg)` between $`r round(pred[2])` and $`r as.integer(round(pred[3]))` with a fit of $`r as.integer(round(pred[1]))`.

This can also be demonstrated through the use of the shiny application:  https://chrisbens.shinyapps.io/CarPricePrediction
