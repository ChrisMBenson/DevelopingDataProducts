This application demonstrates the use of shinyapps to predict the price of a car based on certain variables

The dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be downloaded here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile.

The application is fully reactive, reacting to a change in any of the input values. Initially default values are selected and a prediction is shown. Chaning any of the inputs will create a new prediction and filter out records where necessary
